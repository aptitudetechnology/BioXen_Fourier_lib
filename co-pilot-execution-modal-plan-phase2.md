# BioXen Execution Modal Upgrade - Phase 2: MVP Expansion

## Phase 2 Overview: Minimal Viable Expansion (Weeks 3-4)

**Objective**: Expand the MVP foundation by integrating AlphaFold for protein structure prediction and adding basic AI-based result validation, demonstrating scalable architecture.

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Priority**: MVP Expansion - Prove scalability  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 MVP foundation complete

## MVP Expansion Vision

### Core Integration Strategy
```
src/execution_modal/
├── __init__.py
├── process_executor.py      # Enhanced with protein structure support
├── tool_integrator.py       # Add AlphaFold integration
├── ai_validator.py          # Basic AI result validation
├── mvp_demo.py              # Enhanced demo workflow
└── phase2_demo.py           # Phase 2 specific demo
```

### MVP Phase 2 Principles
1. **Single Tool Addition**: Integrate AlphaFold for protein structure prediction
2. **Basic AI Validation**: Add simple AI-based result validation (not full reasoning)
3. **Incremental**: Build directly on Phase 1, no breaking changes
4. **Validation Focus**: Demonstrate scientific validity of results
5. **Community Standard**: Use AlphaFold database API

## Week 3: AlphaFold Integration

### Day 1-2: AlphaFold Wrapper
- Implement minimal wrapper for AlphaFold database API
- Support protein sequence input and structure output

### Day 3-4: Process Executor Enhancement
- Extend `process_executor.py` to route protein structure requests to AlphaFold
- Add fallback to symbolic execution for unsupported protein processes

---

## Week 4: AI Validation & Demo

### Day 5-6: Basic AI Validator
- Implement `ai_validator.py` for simple result validation (e.g., confidence score threshold)
- Integrate with process executor for post-processing

### Day 7-8: Demo & Testing
- Create `phase2_demo.py` to demonstrate protein structure prediction and validation
- Add basic test cases for AlphaFold integration and AI validation
