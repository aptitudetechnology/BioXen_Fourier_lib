# BioXen Execution Modal Upgrade - Phase 3: MVP Finalization

## Phase 3 Overview: Minimal Viable Finalization (Weeks 5-6)

**Objective**: Finalize the MVP execution modal by adding basic genomic mapping and minimal spatial simulation, ensuring the framework is robust, extensible, and ready for broader community use.

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Priority**: MVP Finalization - Robustness and extensibility  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 MVP expansion complete

## MVP Finalization Vision

### Core Integration Strategy
```
src/execution_modal/
├── __init__.py
├── process_executor.py      # Enhanced with genomic mapping & spatial simulation
├── tool_integrator.py       # Add minimal genome parser
├── spatial_simulator.py     # Basic spatial simulation stub
├── mvp_demo.py              # Finalized demo workflow
└── phase3_demo.py           # Phase 3 specific demo
```

### MVP Phase 3 Principles
1. **Minimal Genomic Mapping**: Add basic genome-to-process mapping (GenBank parser)
2. **Minimal Spatial Simulation**: Add stub for spatial simulation (no full Virtual Cell integration)
3. **Extensible**: Ensure codebase is ready for future tool additions
4. **Community Ready**: Provide clear documentation and examples
5. **Non-Breaking**: Preserve all existing functionality

## Week 5: Genomic Mapping

### Day 1-2: Minimal Genome Parser
- Implement GenBank parser to extract gene features
- Map genes to basic biological processes

### Day 3-4: Process Executor Enhancement
- Extend `process_executor.py` to support genome-driven process execution
- Add fallback to symbolic execution for unsupported genome features

---

## Week 6: Spatial Simulation & Final Demo

### Day 5-6: Spatial Simulation Stub
- Implement `spatial_simulator.py` with basic diffusion simulation (no full 3D modeling)
- Integrate with process executor for spatial process requests

### Day 7-8: Final Demo & Documentation
- Create `phase3_demo.py` to demonstrate genomic mapping and spatial simulation
- Finalize documentation and quickstart examples
