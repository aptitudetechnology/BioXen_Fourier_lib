### ✅ Task 3: Updated refactor-plan.md
**File:** `refactor-lib-plan.md` (Updated)

Added prominent warning section at the top:
- **Prerequisites section** explaining required completion of Phases 1-4
- **When to Execute** guidelines
- **Why Wait** explanation of premature optimization risks
- Clear gating: Don't refactor until performance validation shows need

### ✅ Task 4: Updated README.md
**File:** `README.md` (Updated)

- Split features into **"Current Features (Working Today)"** vs **"Planned Features (In Development)"**
- Added **"What Works Today vs. What's Planned"** section with code examples
- Clear visual indicators (✅ for working, 🔄 for planned)
- Links to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md and DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
- Honest about what exists vs. what's aspirational

### ✅ Task 5: Codebase Audit
**Findings documented in:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

**Files Audited:**
- `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/analysis/system_analyzer.py` ✅ (1,336 lines)
- `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/api/factory.py` ✅ (153 lines)
- `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/api/biological_vm.py` ✅ (109 lines)
- `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/monitoring/profiler.py` ✅ (786 lines)
- `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/hypervisor/` ✅
- `server/tests/` ✅ (10 files, ~3,000 lines)

**Audit Results:**
- SystemAnalyzer exists and is complete ✅
- All 4 lenses fully implemented ✅
- VMs generate time-series data via profiler ✅
- VM-analysis integration does NOT exist ❌
- Continuous simulation mode does NOT exist ❌
- Self-regulation features do NOT exist ❌

## 📊 Documentation Alignment Status

| Document | Before Alignment | After Alignment | Status |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| README.md | Mixed current/planned features | Clear separation with ✅/🔄 indicators | ✅ Aligned |
| refactor-lib-plan.md | No prerequisites | Prominent warning + prerequisites | ✅ Aligned |
| IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md | Didn't exist | Comprehensive audit | ✅ Created |
| DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md | Didn't exist | 6-phase plan with tasks | ✅ Created |
| arcitecture-alignment.md | Task list | Completion summary (this doc) | ✅ Complete |

## 🎯 Key Insights from Audit

### Strengths
1. **Solid Foundation**: VM engine and SystemAnalyzer are production-ready
2. **Complete Four-Lens Implementation**: All 1,336 lines implemented with scientific rigor
3. **Test-Driven Future**: PyCWT-mod has 100+ tests ready (TDD approach)
4. **Clear Architecture**: Good separation of concerns (VM, hypervisor, analysis, monitoring)

### Gaps
1. **Integration Missing**: VMs and analysis system exist separately, not connected
2. **No Continuous Mode**: VMs execute discrete processes, not continuous time-series
3. **No Self-Regulation**: Vision of VMs using analysis to adjust behavior not implemented
4. **Profiler Not Automatic**: Analysis must be manually triggered

### Path Forward
- Follow the roadmap: Phases 1-3 for MVP (6-8 weeks)
- Phase 4 validates if optimization needed
- Phases 5-6 only if performance requires it

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)
**Ready to start:** All prerequisites met

1. Implement continuous analysis loop in `profiler.py`
2. Add automatic periodic analysis (every 60s)
3. Implement anomaly detection and alerting
4. Add analysis history API
5. Test with real VM workloads

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**Blocker:** None - ready to proceed

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Review status and roadmap
cat docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
cat docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md

# 2. Start Phase 1 implementation
cd src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/monitoring/
# Edit profiler.py according to Phase 1 tasks

# 3. Test as you go
pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Move to Phase 2 when Phase 1 complete
# (Follow roadmap tasks sequentially)
```

## 📞 Questions & Next Actions

**Q: What should I work on next?**  
A: Start Phase 1 (Profiler Real-Time Analysis) from DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md

**Q: Can I skip to Phase 5 (Refactor)?**  
A: No - Prerequisites must be met first (see refactor-lib-plan.md warning)

**Q: Is the four-lens system ready to use?**  
A: Yes! SystemAnalyzer is fully functional for analyzing time-series data

**Q: Can VMs self-regulate yet?**  
A: No - That's Phase 3 (requires Phase 1+2 first)

**Q: Should I implement the PyCWT-mod server now?**  
A: No - Wait until Phase 4 shows performance bottlenecks justify it
