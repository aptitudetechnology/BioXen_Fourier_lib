# Factory Pattern API Refactor Report (Prompt 2)

## Refined Prompt Requirements

1. Add a `BiologicalVM` abstract base class wrapping existing VM functionality:
   - Methods: `start_transcription(genes)`, `allocate_ribosomes(count)`, `get_atp_level()`, `execute_metabolic_pathway(pathway)`, `get_vm_status()`
2. Implement concrete `Syn3AVM` and `EColiVM` classes inheriting from `BiologicalVM`, integrating with hypervisor and genome integrator
3. Add a `create_bio_vm(vm_id, vm_type, config)` factory function to instantiate and connect VMs to the hypervisor
4. Create a `BioResourceManager` class centralizing ribosome, ATP, and memory management from the hypervisor
5. Adapt config dictionary patterns into a unified configuration management system
6. Preserve all existing hypervisor core functionality; refactor should be a wrapper/interface layer

## Codebase Alignment & Recommendations

- The codebase already has robust VM, resource, and genome management, but lacks a unified API and factory pattern.
- VM logic is distributed across hypervisor, resource allocation, and genome integrator classes, not wrapped in a base class or unified interface.
- No dedicated `BiologicalVM` base class or concrete VM subclasses; VMs are generic and genome-driven.
- Resource management (ribosomes, ATP, memory) is present but not centralized in a `BioResourceManager` class.
- Config management uses dictionaries/templates, but not a unified system.

### Recommendations for Refactor

- Implement the `BiologicalVM` base class as a wrapper/interface to existing VM logic.
- Create `Syn3AVM` and `EColiVM` classes that use the base class and connect to the hypervisor and genome integrator.
- Add a `create_bio_vm(vm_id, vm_type, config)` factory function for VM instantiation and registration.
- Refactor resource management into a `BioResourceManager` class, moving logic from the hypervisor.
- Centralize config management for VMs into a unified system/class.
- Ensure all changes are additive and do not disrupt existing hypervisor functionality.

## Summary

The refined prompt is well-aligned with the current architecture and will provide a cleaner, unified API for biological VMs. The recommended refactor will improve maintainability and extensibility while preserving all core features.
