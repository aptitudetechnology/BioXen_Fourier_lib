# bioxen-jcvi-vm-lib v0.0.5 Upgrade Path: Hypervisor-Focused Library

**Date:** September 5, 2025
**Goal:** Deliver a production-ready library with full hypervisor support, excluding JCVI tools and genome downloader.

---

## Strategic Direction
- The library will focus exclusively on virtualization and VM management features.
- JCVI integration and genome download functionality will be excluded from this package.
- All hypervisor modules, VM lifecycle management, resource allocation, chassis selection, monitoring, and related features will be included and documented.

---

## Upgrade Path Steps

### 1. Hypervisor Module Packaging
- Ensure all code in `src/hypervisor/` is included and exposed via the library API.
- Validate that VM lifecycle operations (create, start, stop, destroy, monitor) are fully supported.
- Include resource management, chassis selection, and monitoring modules.

### 2. Factory Pattern API
- Provide robust factory functions:
  - `create_bio_vm(vm_id, biological_type, vm_type, config)`
  - `create_biological_vm(vm_type, config)`
- Support all infrastructure types ("basic", "xcpng") and biological types ("syn3a", "ecoli", "minimal_cell").
- Remove JCVI optimization modes and related configuration options.

### 3. CLI and Interactive Tools
- Retain interactive CLI for VM management and monitoring only.
- Remove genome acquisition and JCVI workflow options from CLI menus.
- Document CLI usage for hypervisor operations.

### 4. Dependencies
- Only include dependencies required for hypervisor, VM management, and CLI (e.g., `pylua-bioxen-vm-lib`, `questionary`).
- Exclude `jcvi`, `ncbi-genome-download`, `biopython`, and related packages.

### 5. Documentation
- Update README and specification to reflect hypervisor-only scope.
- Clearly state that JCVI and genome download features are not included in this version.
- Provide extension points for future JCVI integration as a separate package.

### 6. Testing and Validation
- Ensure all hypervisor and VM management features are covered by tests.
- Remove or stub out tests related to JCVI and genome acquisition.
- Validate production readiness for virtualization features.

---

## Summary
This upgrade path delivers a focused, production-ready library for biological virtualization and VM management, with full hypervisor support and no JCVI or genome download dependencies. Future JCVI integration can be provided as a separate package.
