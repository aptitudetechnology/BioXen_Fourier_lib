# Phase 1 Feature 2 Complete: Wavelet Optimization

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing  
**Branch:** dev

---

## 🎯 Achievement Summary

**Feature 2: Automatic Wavelet Selection** is now fully implemented!

The system can now **automatically select the optimal wavelet** for any biological signal, eliminating manual trial-and-error and providing research-grade transparency.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Algorithm: Automatic Wavelet Selection

**Location:** `src/bioxen_fourier_vm_lib/analysis/system_analyzer.py`

**New Method:** `_select_optimal_wavelet()`
- Tests all 7 available wavelets
- Calculates 4 metrics for each
- Computes weighted composite score
- Returns best wavelet + alternatives
- ~120 lines of sophisticated signal processing

**Available Wavelets:**
1. **morl** - Morlet (smooth oscillations)
2. **mexh** - Mexican Hat (peak detection)
3. **gaus4** - Gaussian 4 (sharp features)
4. **db4** - Daubechies 4 (balanced)
5. **db8** - Daubechies 8 (smoother)
6. **sym4** - Symlet 4 (symmetric)
7. **coif2** - Coiflet 2 (orthogonal)

### 2. Four Selection Metrics

Each metric scores wavelets on [0, 1] scale (higher = better):

**Energy Concentration (30% weight):**
- Method: `_calculate_energy_concentration()`
- Measures: How focused is signal energy?
- Uses: Gini coefficient on power distribution
- Best for: Signals with well-defined features

**Time Localization (25% weight):**
- Method: `_calculate_time_localization()`
- Measures: Can we pinpoint event timing?
- Uses: Entropy of time-domain power
- Best for: Sharp transient detection

**Frequency Localization (25% weight):**
- Method: `_calculate_frequency_localization()`
- Measures: Are frequency bands distinct?
- Uses: Entropy of scale-domain power
- Best for: Multi-frequency signals

**Edge Quality (20% weight):**
- Method: `_calculate_edge_quality()`
- Measures: Boundary artifact minimization
- Uses: Edge/center power ratio
- Best for: Long signals with important edges

**Total Score:** Weighted sum of all metrics

### 3. Enhanced API

**New Parameter:** `auto_select=True` in `wavelet_lens()`

```python
# MVP mode (manual selection) - STILL WORKS
result = analyzer.wavelet_lens(signal, wavelet_name='morl')

# Phase 1 mode (automatic selection) - NEW!
result = analyzer.wavelet_lens(signal, auto_select=True)
print(f"Optimal: {result.wavelet_used}")
print(f"Score: {result.selection_score['total_score']:.3f}")

# See alternatives
for name, scores in result.alternative_wavelets[:3]:
    print(f"{name}: {scores['total_score']:.3f}")
```

### 4. Enhanced Results

**WaveletResult now includes:**
- `wavelet_used` - Name of wavelet (always present now)
- `selection_score` - Dict with all metric scores (when auto_select=True)
- `alternative_wavelets` - List of (name, scores) sorted by score (when auto_select=True)
