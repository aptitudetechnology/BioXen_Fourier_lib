# Genomic Code Virtualization Framework for BioXen_jcvi_vm_lib

## System Architecture Integration

### Core Integration Objective
Extend the BioXen_jcvi_vm_lib factory pattern API to create virtualized cellular execution environments where genomic code runs directly, providing isolated computational contexts for executing biological programs from genome to phenotype.

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Genomic Code Execution Engine
**API Extensions:**
```python
# Extend existing factory pattern for genomic virtualization
vm = create_bio_vm("genomic_vm", "ecoli_mg1655", "basic", config={
    "genomic_virtualization": {
        "enabled": True,
        "genome_file": "/data/genomes/ecoli_mg1655.gbk",
        "execution_mode": "direct",  # direct genomic code execution
        "virtual_resources": {"atp_pool": 1000, "ribosome_count": 7000}
    }
})

# New genomic virtualization manager
from bioxen_jcvi_vm_lib.api import GenomicVirtualizationManager
gv_manager = GenomicVirtualizationManager()
```

**Genomic Execution Runtime:**
- Direct gene expression network execution
- Real-time metabolic pathway processing
- Active protein synthesis and degradation
- Dynamic DNA replication and cell division
- Live regulatory circuit execution
- Real-time resource allocation and competition

### Phase 2: Cellular Process Virtualization
**VM Process Extensions:**
```python
# Execute genomic code directly in virtualized cellular context
result = vm.execute_biological_process('run_operon(["lacZ", "lacY", "lacA"])')
division_state = vm.execute_biological_process('execute_cell_cycle_checkpoint()')
metabolic_state = vm.execute_biological_process('run_metabolic_pathways(glucose_available=True)')
```

**Core Virtualized Processes:**
- Gene regulatory network execution engines
- Metabolic pathway execution contexts
- Protein synthesis execution environments
- Cell cycle progression execution logic
- DNA maintenance execution routines
- Stress response execution handlers

### Phase 3: Multi-Scale Virtualization Layer
**Genomic Hypervisor Interface:**
```python
# Multi-scale cellular virtualization
cell_context = vm.execute_biological_process('create_cellular_context({
    "runtime_duration": 60,  # seconds of virtualized cellular time
    "environmental_context": {"temperature": 37, "pH": 7.0, "nutrients": ["glucose", "phosphate"]},
    "execution_isolation": True
})')
```

**Virtualization Capabilities:**
- Isolated gene regulatory network execution
- Containerized metabolic pathway processing
- Sandboxed protein-protein interaction execution
- Virtualized spatial cellular organization
- Isolated population-level behavior execution

## Implementation Architecture

### Genomic Virtualization Manager Component
```python
class GenomicVirtualizationManager:
    def load_genome_runtime(self, genome_file: str) -> GenomicRuntime
    def create_cellular_context(self, genome_runtime: GenomicRuntime) -> CellularContext

                                           ↓
               Existing Hypervisor Core ← Virtualized Cellular Processes
