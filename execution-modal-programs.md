# Execution Modal Programs for BioXen Genomic Virtualization

This document surveys existing open-source programs and platforms that can be leveraged to develop the BioXen execution modal, focusing on virtualization of genome code and biological process simulation. The goal is to integrate, extend, or interoperate with established tools rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Program Suitability Criteria
- **High**: Directly supports genome-scale modeling, simulation, or process virtualization; easy integration with Python; open standards (SBML, SBOL, Antimony)
- **Medium-High**: Supports relevant biological modeling domains; may require adaptation or bridging
- **Medium**: Useful for specific tasks or domains; partial fit for full genome virtualization
- **Low-Medium**: Useful for structure-level or molecular tasks; limited for whole-genome virtualization

## Integration Strategy
- Prefer Python-based APIs and SBML/SBOL standards for interoperability
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and visualization
- Leverage model repositories for curated genome-scale models
- Integrate metabolic, systems biology, and protein structure tools as modular components
- Avoid duplicating functionality already available in mature open-source projects

## Next Steps
- Prototype BioXen execution modal using COBRApy, Tellurium, and VCell for metabolic and systems biology simulation
- Use AlphaFold for protein structure prediction as a downstream analysis
- Develop SBML/SBOL import/export pipelines for model interoperability
- Build interactive workflows in Jupyter Notebooks
- Engage with open-source communities for collaboration and extension
