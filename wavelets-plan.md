## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

Wavelets are **THE PERFECT TOOL** for biological signal analysis because biological systems operate at multiple timescales simultaneously. Unlike Fourier transforms which assume stationary signals, wavelets provide **time-frequency localization** - essential for detecting when biological events occur and how frequency content changes over time.

### Why Wavelets Matter for Biology
- **Multi-timescale Detection**: From millisecond ion channels to circadian rhythms
- **Non-stationary Analysis**: Cell cycle transitions, stress responses, development
- **Transient Event Detection**: Heat shock, drug responses, phase changes
- **Noise Robustness**: Preserve biological signals while removing measurement artifacts
- **Time-Frequency Precision**: See exactly when frequency changes occur
